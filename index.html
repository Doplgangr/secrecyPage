<p>Secrecy is where you can safely put your files without worrying that others will see it... They just can't.</p>

<p>This project was started since we have tried a number of Apps for secure file storage, while not finding one that best suits our expectations:</p>

<ul>
<li>some, like Vaulty and Hide it pro, do not store videos securely and just stores the raw file</li>
<li>most only support storing pictures and videos. I occasionally want to store word documents but can't find a way.</li>
<li>some produced by major software companies are simply bloated and litters temp files everywhere... That's just as insecure as not using them.</li>
</ul>

<p>We aim to produce an all-rounded one that maximizes security but still ensuring ease of use and quick encryption time.</p>
