They just can't.\r\n\r\nI am starting this project since I have tried a number of Apps for secure file storage, while not finding one that best suits my expectations:\r\n- some, like Vaulty and Hide it pro, do not store videos securely and just stores the raw file\r\n- most only support storing pictures and videos. I occasionally want to store word documents but can't find a way.\r\n- some produced by major software companies are simply bloated and litters temp files everywhere... That's just as insecure as not using them.\r\n\r\nI am aiming to produce an all-rounded one that maximizes security but still ensuring ease of use and quick encryption time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting started\r\n=============\r\nPlease look at the README under each folder, starting with /app\r\n\r\nSupport Forum\r\n=============\r\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2704486\r\n\r\nPlay Store\r\n============\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doplgangr.secrecy\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
